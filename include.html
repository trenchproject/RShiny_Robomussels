<h3> Two Meters Is Too Tall</h3>

Imagine you wanted to know how to pack for a trip to Barcelona this weekend, but the only information you had about the weather came from an air temperature sensor tucked inside a plastic shade and perched at the top of a pole 3,000 feet tall. Plus, you were only given one average temperature reading for each day. You'd probably make some grave errors in judgement when you picked out what clothes to take.

It sounds nuts, but this isn't too different from the situation faced by a biologist who wants to understand the effects of a changing climate on, for example, a ground-living beetle the size of their thumbnail. The only environmental data available might come from a sensor that's mounted two meters high, the typical height for a weather station. But temperatures here can be very different from where the beetle is on the ground—especially if, unlike the sensor, it's moving from sunny spot to shaded spot. And often, the biologist might only have access to temperature data averaged over days, months, or even years. It's very challenging to predict what a small, moving organism is actually experiencing over time using such spatially and temporally coarse information about the environment.

<h3>Robomussels to the Rescue</h3>

Marine ecologist <a href = http://www.northeastern.edu/helmuthlab/People/Helmuth.html target = "_blank">Brian Helmuth</a> did things a little differently when he wanted to understand how four species of intertidal mussels experience climate. Mussels are <b>ectotherms</b> that live along the seashore in places that are covered by water when the tide is high but exposed to the air and sun when the tide is low. Being an ectotherm, mussels depend on external sources for body temperature regulation such as sunlight or wind. Therefore, the tide plays an important role on the temperatures they experience. You can see one of his study species in the photograph on the right. Notice that while mussels are <b>sedentary</b>, meaning they don't move or behaviorally thermoregulate (like the beetle in the example above), the conditions they're experiencing keep changing with the tides—and beyond. For instance, if they get splashed by a wave during a low tide, mussel body temperatures can rapidly drop temporarily.

Helmuth's approach was to use a tool called a <b>biomimetic</b> logger to collect temperature data at a mussel-relevant spatial and temporal scales. He used tools that were mussel-sized and collected data where these animals actually live every 10 to 30 minutes. The word "Biomimetic"—"bio" reffering  to"life" and "mimetic" originated from "mime"—means "imitating life", and that's exactly what he did. Helmuth and his research team embedded tiny, button-sized temperature sensors (or loggers) like <a href = https://envcoglobal.com/catalog/microclimate-monitoring/weather/microclimate-mini-loggers/datalogging-sensors/temperature-0 target = "_blank">this one</a> inside artificial shells made of epoxy (a kind of plastic). The artificial shells were designed to mimic the shape, color, size, and thermal properties (how fast something heats and cools) of mussels, so the researchers could get a better idea of how real mussels experience their environments. This was an important step, because as you can see in the images below, even organisms that are roughly the same size and living in the same environments can have very different body temperatures depending on their physical properties.

These "robomussels" were attached to rocks within existing mussel beds, surrounded by living mussels. Robomussels were also placed in multiple locations within sites, to capture the variable thermal conditions mussels experience as a result of differences in substrates, shading, and submersion. All this thermal variability would have been missed if Helmuth only looked at air temperatures collected by a nearby weather station.
