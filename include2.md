### Extreme Mussel Environments

Researchers in the [Buckley lab](http://faculty.washington.edu/lbuckley/), where this website comes from, wanted to use Helmuth's robomussel data to ask questions about how intertidal mussels experience environmental extremes and variability. Luckily, he had been kind and smart enough to share it all freely, which is something scientists are starting to do more and more. You can look at it yourself [right here](https://datadryad.org/resource/doi:10.5061/dryad.6n8kf). The following figures were made by Lauren Buckley, Anthony Cannistra, and Aji John using Helmuth's data. 

The interactive figures below allow you to plot the maximum daily temperatures recorded by robomussels at several different study sites during the summer season. On the x-axis, you'll see the day of the year (e.g. 200 means July 19) and on the y-axis, the maximum daily temperature in celsius. The different colors within each plot reflect data collected by robomussels that were placed in different subsites (mussel beds) with different tidal heights, and therefore exposed for more or less of the day. It's useful to look at maximum daily temperatures because looking at daily averages smooths out differences both within and across sites. Maximum temperatures can also tell us about extreme conditions faced by these mussel populations, and help forecast future extremes. 

Try answering the following questions:

1. Is there more variation in maximum daily temperature across sites, within sites, or across time? What kinds of conditions could be different across sites, within sites, or across time that would explain what you see?
    
2. Look back at the map above and remind yourself how the sites line up along a latitudinal **gradient**:         
     2.1 Which sites do you predict will experience the most extreme (highest) daily maxima—northern, southern, or central?         
     2.2. After plotting all the sites, does your prediction hold true? Why or why not? (Hint: Consider [when low tides occur](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tide_predictions.html) in different places.)
