### Variation over Time

The interactive figure below allows you to plot the maximum daily temperatures recorded by robomussels at several different study sites during the summer season. On the x-axis, you'll see the day of the year (e.g. 200 means July 19) and on the y-axis, the maximum daily temperature in celsius. The different colors within each plot reflect data collected by robomussels that were placed in different subsites (mussel beds) with different tidal heights, and therefore exposed for more or less of the day. It's useful to look at maximum daily temperatures because they tend to vary more than daily averages both within and across sites, and can tell us about extreme conditions faced by these mussel populations. 

Try answering the following questions:

1. During which span of time is there the most variation in maximum daily temperature:         
     1.1 Across sites?               
     1.2 Within sites?
    
2. Look back at the map above and remind yourself how the sites line up along a latitudinal **gradient**:         
     2.1 Which sites do you predict will experience the most extreme (highest) daily maxima—northern, southern, or central?         
      2.2. After plotting all the sites, does your prediction hold true? Why or why not? (Hint: Consider [when low tides occur](https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/tide_predictions.html) in different places.)
