### Predicting Organismal Responses to Climate
Hopefully, exploring the robomussel data has made it clear how important it is to measure environmental conditions at the right spatial and temporal scale for the particular organism you are interested in. It would be impossible to understand how intertidal mussels experience their current climate, let alone how they might respond to climatic changes, without a clear understanding of how much their environments vary across space (even within one site!) and time, as well as by considering extremes of climate and not just averages.
