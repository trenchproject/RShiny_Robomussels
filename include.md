## How Organisms Experience Climate: A Case Study

### Two Meters is Too Tall
Imagine you wanted to know how to pack for a trip to Barcelona this weekend, but the only information you had about the weather came from an air temperature sensor tucked inside a plastic shade and perched at the top of a pole 3,000 feet tall. Plus, you were only given one average temperature reading for each day. You'd probably make some grave errors in judgement when you picked out what clothes to take. 

It sounds nuts, but this isn't too different from the situation faced by a biologist who wants to understand the effects of a changing climate on, for example, a ground-living beetle the size of their thumbnail. The only environmental data available might come from a weather station that's two meters high, where temperatures can be very different from where the beetle is on the ground—especially if, unlike the sensor, it's moving from sunny spot to shaded spot. And often, the biologist might only have access to temperature data averaged over days, months, or even years. It's very challenging to predict what a small, moving organism is actually experiencing over time using such spatially and temporally coarse information about the environment.

### Robomussels to the Rescue
Marine ecologist [Brian Helmuth](http://www.northeastern.edu/helmuthlab/People/Helmuth.html) did things a little differently when he wanted to understand how four species of intertidal mussels experience climate. Mussels are **ectotherms** that live along the seashore in places that are covered by water when the tide is high but exposed to the air and sun when the tide is low. You can see one of his study species in the photograph below. Notice that while mussels are **sedentary**, meaning they don't move or behaviorally thermoregulate (like the beetle in the example above), the conditions they're experiencing keep changing with the tides—and beyond. For instance, if they get splashed by a wave during a low tide, mussel body temperatures can rapidly drop temporarily.

Helmuth's approach was to use a tool called a **biomimetic** logger to collect temperature data at a mussel-relevant spatial scale—i.e. mussel-sized, and collected where these animals actually live—and temporal scale, with recordings taken every 10 to 30 minutes. "Biomimetic" means "imitating life", and that's exactly what he did. Helmuth and his research team embedded tiny, button-sized temperature sensors (or loggers) like [this one](https://envcoglobal.com/catalog/microclimate-monitoring/weather/microclimate-mini-loggers/datalogging-sensors/temperature-0) inside artificial shells made of epoxy (a kind of plastic). The artificial shells were designed to mimic the shape, color, size, and thermal properties (how fast something heats and cools) of mussels, so the researchers could get a much better idea of how real mussels experience their environments. These "robomussels" were attached to rocks at different locations within existing mussel beds, surrounded by living mussels. 

The map below shows the locations at which robomussels were deployed along the Pacific Coast of North America, to capture the environments of mussel populations from Washington to Oregon.
