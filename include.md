## How Organisms Experience Climate: A Case Study

### Two Meters is Too Tall
Imagine you wanted to know how to pack for a trip to Barcelona this weekend, but the only information you had about the weather came from an air temperature sensor tucked inside a plastic shade and perched at the top of a pole 3,000 feet tall. Plus, you were only given one average temperature reading for each day. You'd probably make some grave errors in judgement when you picked out what clothes to take. 

It sounds nuts, but this isn't too different from the situation faced by a biologist who wants to understand the effects of a changing climate on, for example, a ground-living beetle the size of their thumbnail. The only environmental data available to them might come from a weather station that's 2 meters high, where temperatures can be very different from where the beetle is on the ground—especially if it's moving from sunny spot to shaded spot. And often, the biologist might only have access to temperature data averaged over days, months, or even years. It's very challenging to predict what a small, moving organism is actually experiencing over time using such spatially and temporally coarse information about the environment.

### Robomussels to the Rescue
Marine ecologist [Brian Helmuth](http://www.northeastern.edu/helmuthlab/People/Helmuth.html) did things a little differently when he wanted to understand how intertidal mussels experience climate. Mussels are **ectotherms** that live along the seashore in places that are covered by water when the tide is high but exposed when the tide is low. You can see one of his study species in the photograph below. Although mussels are **sedentary**,
