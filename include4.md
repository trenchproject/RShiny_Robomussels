### Visualizing Levels of Thermal Stress Across Space and Time
In this final visualization, you can explore mean monthly maxima of daily temperatures. These are averages, for each month of the year, of the highest daily temperatures recorded in that month across all the years when robomussels were recording. You'll see a simplified heat map called a quilt plot, in which colors stand in for numerical values—with higher temperatures represented by hotter colors. The months of the year are arrayed from left to right, and latitudes increase from bottom to top.
