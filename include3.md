### Patterns in Variation Over Time
One of the questions Buckley and her team had was whether the temporal variation in the highest temperatures mussels tend to experience is predictable—that is, within a given mussel bed, are there particular periods during which there is more or less variation in extreme heat? 

One way of approaching this problem is by applying a mathematical technique known as a Fourier transform. The details of this are not very important, but essentially, what the researchers were doing here is looking for patterns in temperature variation over time. To quantify variation, they used a measurement called an **amplitude**, 

2) Spectral analysis is carried out to describe how variation in a time series may be accounted for by cyclic components. This may also be referred to as "Frequency Domain". With this an estimate of the spectrum over a range of frequencies can be obtained and periodic components in a noisy environment can be separated out.
