<!--### Patterns in Variation Over Time
Buckley and her team wondered whether the temporal variation in the highest temperatures mussels tend to experience was predictable—that is, within a given mussel bed, were there particular periods during which there was more or less variation in extreme heat?

One way of approaching this problem is by applying a mathematical technique known as a [Fourier transform](https://academic.oup.com/icb/article/56/1/14/2363343), which breaks up a complicated signal into simpler component parts. The details of this are not very important, but essentially, what the researchers were doing is looking for patterns in temperature variation over time. To quantify this variation, they used a measurement called **amplitude** and plotted it against **frequency**. What this tells us is how the amount of variation in temperature (amplitude) is affected by the length of time we're looking at (frequency). This kind of analysis can help pinpoint cyclic, or repeating, events that drive variation. As a silly example, if you did a Fourier transform using data on your level of happiness and discovered large peaks in amplitude at frequencies of one week and one month, you might be able to determine that your weekly lunch date with your best friend and your monthly review from your boss were responsible for large amounts of variation in your mood!

The interactive figures below allow you to plot the amplitude of temperature variation at the same study sites you saw above as a function of time frequency (don't worry about the logarithmic/reciprocal values). The different colors within each plot again reflect different subsites.

### What Are Mussels?

We will start by learning more about mussels, particularly those found in Puget Sound so we can understand their role in the environment closer to home.

Similar to geoducks, oysters, and clams, mussels belong to a class of organisms known as bivalves. Bivalves are filter feeders, meaning they eat by drawing the surrounding water in through a siphon and consuming the phytoplankton (microscopic plants) and decomposing material they remove from the water. Bivalves serve as important water filterers cleaning up the water around them. This can also sometimes mean that they can be dangerous to eat because they can contain high levels of bacteria and toxins from filtering the water.

Bivalves create important habitats for other organisms. Their shells form many small cracks and crevices. Many species along the shore and more shallow waters can hide in these crevices and use them as shelter from predators.

Bivalves are also "grown" by many different farmers who sell these mussels, clams, oysters, and geoducks for money. This is a profitable industry in Washington state and is an important part of the local economy, especially in rural areas.

### A Steep Decline

This graph shows the number of native oysters that were caught annually from the mid-19th century to the mid-20th century. 

Warming temperatures decrease the ability of bivalves to reproduce effectively, and they increase the amount of food bivalves have to eat. In addition, when water warms, it holds less oxygen. Bivalves do not do well in low-oxygen environments.  Another challenge caused by climate warming is ocean acidification, which makes it more difficult for bivalve larvae to survive and grow to be mature adults. Ocean acidification also damages the adult shells.
