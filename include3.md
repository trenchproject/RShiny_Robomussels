### Patterns in Variation Over Time
Buckley and her team wondered whether the temporal variation in the highest temperatures mussels tend to experience was predictable—that is, within a given mussel bed, were there particular periods during which there was more or less variation in extreme heat? 

One way of approaching this problem is by applying a mathematical technique known as a Fourier transform, which breaks up a complicated signal into simpler component parts. The details of this are not very important, but essentially, what the researchers were doing is looking for patterns in temperature variation over time. To quantify this variation, they used a measurement called **amplitude** and plotted it against **frequency**. What this tells us is how the amount of variation in temperature (amplitude) is affected by the length of time we're looking at (frequency). This kind of analysis can help pinpoint cyclic, or repeating, events that drive variation. As a silly example, if you did a Fourier transform using data on your level of happiness and discovered large peaks in amplitude at frequencies of one week and one month, you might be able to determine that your weekly meeting with your best friend and your monthly review from your boss were responsible for large amounts of variation in your mood!

The interactive figures below allow you to plot the amplitude of temperature variation at the same study sites you saw above as a function of time frequency (don't worry about the logarithmic/reciprocal values). The different colors within each plot again reflect different subsites. 

Try answering the following questions:

1. At what frequencies do you see peaks in amplitude? Are these patterns the same across sites?          

2. What cyclic events could be driving the fact that we tend to see increases in temperature variation every:       
     2.1 Two weeks?     
     2.2. One year?
